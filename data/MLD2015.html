activities, money launderers and financers of terrorism could try to 
take advantage of the freedom of capital movements and the freedom to 
supply financial services which the Union's integrated financial area 
entails. Therefore, certain coordinating measures are necessary at Union
 level. At the same time, the objectives of protecting society from 
crime and protecting the stability and integrity of the Union's 
financial system should be balanced against the need to create a 
regulatory environment that allows companies to grow their businesses 
without incurring disproportionate compliance costs.</p>

 extended the scope of Directive 91/308/EEC both in terms of the crimes 
covered and in terms of the range of professions and activities covered.
 In June 2003, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) revised its 
Recommendations to cover terrorist financing, and provided more detailed
 requirements in relation to customer identification and verification, 
the situations where a higher risk of money laundering or terrorist 
financing may justify enhanced measures and also the situations where a 
reduced risk may justify less rigorous controls. Those changes were 
reflected in Directive 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the 
Council<a id="ntc6-L_2015141EN.01007301-E0006" href="#ntr6-L_2015141EN.01007301-E0006" shape="rect">&nbsp;(<span class="super">6</span>)</a> and in Commission Directive 2006/70/EC<a id="ntc7-L_2015141EN.01007301-E0007" href="#ntr7-L_2015141EN.01007301-E0007" shape="rect">&nbsp;(<span class="super">7</span>)</a>.</p>

financing are frequently carried out in an international context. 
Measures adopted solely at national or even at Union level, without 
taking into account international coordination and cooperation, would 
have very limited effect. The measures adopted by the Union in that 
field should therefore be compatible with, and at least as stringent as,
 other actions undertaken in international fora. Union action should 
continue to&nbsp;take particular account of the FATF Recommendations and
 instruments of other international bodies active in the&nbsp;fight 
against money laundering and terrorist financing. With a view to 
reinforcing the efficacy of the fight against money laundering and 
terrorist financing, the relevant Union legal acts should, where 
appropriate, be aligned with the International Standards on Combating 
Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation 
adopted by the FATF in February 2012 (the ‘revised FATF 
Recommendations’).</p>

review specific cross-border threats that could affect the internal

the Expert Group on Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing and the 
representatives from the FIUs, as well as, where appropriate, from other
 Union-level bodies, is essential for the effectiveness of that process.
 National risk assessments and experience are also an important source 
of information for the process. Such assessment of the cross-border 
risks by the Commission should not involve the processing of personal 
data. In any event, data should be fully anonymised. National and Union 
data protection supervisory authorities should be involved only if the 
assessment of the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing has 
an impact on the privacy and data protection of individuals.</p>

be needed to facilitate coordination, including the exchange of 
information between FIUs within the Union. It may regularly convene 
meetings of the EU FIUs' Platform composed of representatives from 
Member States' FIUs, in order to facilitate cooperation among FIUs, 
exchange views and provide advice on implementation issues relevant for 
FIUs and reporting entities as well as on cooperation-related issues 
such as effective FIU cooperation, the identification of suspicious 
transactions with a cross-border dimension, the standardisation of 
reporting formats through the FIU.net or its successor, the joint 
analysis of cross-border cases, and the identification of trends and

that FIUs exchange, spontaneously or upon request, any information that 
may be relevant for the processing or analysis of information by the FIU
 related to money laundering or terrorist financing and the natural or 
legal person involved, even if the type of predicate offences that may 
be involved is not identified at the time of the exchange.</p>
      <p class="normal">A request shall contain the relevant facts, 
background information, reasons for the request and how the information 
sought will be used. Different exchange mechanisms may apply if so 
agreed between the FIUs, in particular as regards exchanges through the 
FIU.net or its successor.</p>

for receiving and analysing information when it replies to a request for
 information referred to in paragraph 1 from another FIU. The FIU to 
whom the request is made shall respond in a timely manner.</p>

information from an obliged entity established in another Member State

established. That FIU shall transfer requests and answers promptly.</p>

exchange information only in exceptional circumstances where the 
exchange could be contrary to fundamental principles of its national

analytical purposes.</p>

documents pursuant to Articles 52 and 53, the transmitting FIU may 
impose restrictions and conditions for the use of that information. The 
receiving FIU shall comply with those restrictions and conditions.</p>

only for the purpose for which it was sought or provided and that any 
dissemination of that information by the receiving FIU to any other 
authority, agency or department, or any use of this information for 
purposes beyond those originally approved, is made subject to the prior 
consent by the FIU providing the information.</p>
      <p class="normal">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member States shall ensure 
that the requested FIU's prior consent to disseminate the information to
 competent authorities is granted promptly and to the largest extent 
possible. The requested FIU shall not refuse its consent to such 
dissemination unless this would fall beyond the scope of application of 
its AML/CFT provisions, could lead to impairment of a criminal 
investigation, would be clearly disproportionate to the legitimate 
interests of a natural or legal person or the Member State of the 
requested FIU, or would otherwise not be in accordance with fundamental 
principles of national law of that Member State. Any such refusal to 
grant consent shall be appropriately explained.</p>

their FIUs cooperate in the application of state-of-the-art technologies
 in accordance with their national law. Those technologies shall allow 
FIUs to match their data with that of other FIUs in an anonymous way by 
ensuring full protection of personal data with the aim of detecting 
subjects of the FIU's interests in other Member States and identifying 
their proceeds and funds.</p>
