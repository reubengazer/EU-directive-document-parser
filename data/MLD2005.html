 was adopted. It required Member States to prohibit money laundering and

other international fora. The Community action should continue to take 
particular account of the Recommendations of the Financial Action Task 
Force (hereinafter referred to as the FATF), which constitutes the 
foremost international body active in the fight against money laundering
 and terrorist financing. Since the FATF Recommendations were 
substantially revised and expanded in 2003, this Directive should be in

aspect of the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, it
 is appropriate, in accordance with the new international standards, to 
introduce more specific and detailed provisions relating to the 
identification of the customer and of any beneficial owner and the 
verification of their identity. To that end a precise definition of 
‘beneficial owner’ is essential. Where the individual beneficiaries of a
 legal entity or arrangement such as a foundation or trust are yet to be
 determined, and it is therefore impossible to identify an individual as
 the beneficial owner, it would suffice to identify the class of persons
 intended to be the beneficiaries of the foundation or trust. This 
requirement should not include the identification of the individuals 
within that class of persons.</p>
